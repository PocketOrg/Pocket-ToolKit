## What this is

A [Pocket Connector](https://usepocket.net/connectors): an MCP server exposing
tools an agent can call. A Connector provides *capability*; a Skill provides the
*knowledge* of how to use it well. Many are best installed as a pair.

## Tools

- `search` — Searches Wikipedia article titles and content.
- `get_article` — Returns an article's text.
- `get_summary` — Returns the lead section of an article.

See [TOOLS.md](./TOOLS.md) for parameters.

## Icon

`icon.svg` is this connector's official mark **in full brand colour**, rendered on
its marketplace card. It comes from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org), which
publishes brand SVGs and their official hex colours under CC0.

Trademarks belong to their respective owners. A mark here indicates the service
this connector talks to, not endorsement by it.

## Install

Pocket runs the server for you. To run it directly:

```bash
npx -y wikipedia-mcp
```

No credentials required.
