# Telegram

Read and send Telegram messages. Use for community and support channels hosted on Telegram.

- **Category** — Documents & Communication
- **Transport** — stdio
- **Auth** — apiKey (read, write)
- **Type** — Connector (MCP server: callable tools)

## What this is

A [Pocket Connector](https://usepocket.net/connectors): an MCP server exposing
tools an agent can call. A Connector provides *capability*; a Skill provides the
*knowledge* of how to use it well. Many are best installed as a pair.

## Tools

- `list_dialogs` — Lists chats and channels the session can reach.
- `read_messages` — Reads recent messages from a chat.
- `send_message` — Sends a message to a chat.

See [TOOLS.md](./TOOLS.md) for parameters.

## Icon

`icon.svg` is this connector's official mark **in full brand colour**, rendered on
its marketplace card. It comes from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org), which
publishes brand SVGs and their official hex colours under CC0.

Trademarks belong to their respective owners. A mark here indicates the service
this connector talks to, not endorsement by it.

## Install

Pocket runs the server for you. To run it directly:

```bash
npx -y mcp-telegram
```

Requires Telegram API credentials and a session. This uses the client protocol rather than a bot token, so it acts as an account — grant it deliberately.
